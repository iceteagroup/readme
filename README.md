# What's  [Wisej.NET](https://wisej.com/)

Wisej.NET provides a platform and set of tools designed to ease the burden of developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining complex business software. It bridges the gap between traditional WinForms-style desktop applications and the web by empowering developers to leverage their existing .NET and C# or VB.NET skills.

Developers are able to use the tools they are familiar with, like a pixel-perfect design surface and drag-and-drop controls with the languages they are comfortable with (C# or VB.NET) to build real-time web applications without having to learn HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. They can stay in their favorite IDE like Visual Studio to take advantage of features like IntelliSense, integrated debugging, design surfaces and source control integration. Front-end developers can leverage their knowledge of web technologies to augment applications and seamlessly integrate third-party packages like HTML5 charting libraries and ASP.NET controls.

To bridge the gap between legacy desktop applications and modern web applications, Wisej.NET provides several features that create a straightforward path to migrate existing applications or build green field projects without having to learn a new set of technologies. Support for touch and gestures is built into the software with emulation to support the desktop experience, localization is a first-class citizen, and the applications Wisej.NET produces are out-of-the-box responsive. That means they are readily accessible from desktop browsers, mobile smartphones and tablets.
